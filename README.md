READ AND UNDERSTAND:
‘PROTO-INDO-EUROPEAN’ IS A CONSPIRACY! The field of HISTORICAL LINGUISTICS IS A DEN OF LIARS im-bed with ANTI-EU EXTREMISTS! 
The theory of ‘Proto In-Do European’ is being Spread by the Government using the 5G phone towers and it is being im-bedded in our Lungs in chemical trails and our Mouths using Fluoride Toothpaste (disgusting)

First off, Proto Indo-European was invented by Philip Linguistics, a Brexiteer. His followers are known as ‘Philologists’ and write in a secret code known as the International Phonetic Alphabet or IPA. But their ideology is anything but International!

The government has put Fluoride into our Toothpaste as a way to speed up the processes of sound change which are lenfiying our dental plosives and taking us further from Esperan’to. The effect is strongest in London and diffuses out across the country over decades and centuries. Have you noticed that in London dental fricatives have started to be replaced by labiodental fricatives? That is the Fluoride Toothpaste talking - which used to be known as Thluoride Thoothpaste and which one day soon will be called Fluoride Foofpaste! (Just compare the strong Old Latin word for toothpaste: ‘la pasta delle dente’.) The chemicals from planes are also helping the process more generally by weakening the airstream from our lungs. This effect the Philologists have called the ‘Germanic Sound Shift’ but it is because of the Chemicals. This means that Latin ‘pater’ weakened (lenified) to English ‘father’ (p>f), ‘tres’ became ‘three’ (t>th), ‘centum’ became ‘hundred’ (k>χ>h), and ‘quando’ became ‘when’ (kw>χw>hw>w).

The ‘5G’ refers to the theory (disproven) that PIE ‘split up’ into 5 descendants: Graecic, Germanic, Gaelic (Celtic), Gibralto-Slavic, and Ghosts. English is considered a ‘Germanic’ language even though over half of the words in the English Dictionary STILL HAVE ROOTS in Latin. STOP using Germanic words - use Latin Vocabulary wherever possible. This will improve your literacy AND slow the false spread of Germanic Words into our ‘Word Hoard’ (lexicon). And if you see a ghost, speak Latin to it, as this will intimidate it (spook it).

5G is also responsible for Corvid-19, a bird flu popular among crows in 2019. Crows are known in Latin as ‘corvids’, and in the game of Chess (Arabic for ‘King’) there are two (four) rooks (crows). Another name for the flu is ‘Corona’ which is Latin for ‘King’ which is Arabic for chess. This isn’t part of the conspiracy, I just think it’s interesting. 
Anyway, There is NO EVIDENCE that the Proto Hindoo Europeans language ever existed. Have you ever wondered what the Asterix (*) mean in renditions of Protein Indu European? They mean that the form is not attested! Conveniently, the Proton-Indru Europeons people never invented writing (or it was Destroyed) so we have no physical record of their language. Conveniently!

Prooto Indo European or ‘Proto Window European’ is actually a secret project to DEFENESTRATE BRITAIN from Europe.

The original language of Europe was called LATIN which the Romans brought along with their Pax Romana (packs of lettuce given as a peace offering). Modern Latin is known as ESPERATNO which means “HOPE” and is an anagram of Saent E(u)ropa. This is a reference to Saint Europe, the proton saint of Europe in Roman Catholicism. Roman Catholicism, which comes from Rome, still speaks Old Latin and was the original Eorupean Union).

“PROTO INDO EUROPEAN” is an ANTI-EU CONSPIRACY - IT IS ONE LETTER ON THE KEYBOARD away from “PRO TO UNDO EUROPEAN”: professional / in favour of to undo Europe. And it is an anagram of AND PEER INTO OUR POO - the evidence of the Myth of P.I.E. is in our faeces (BREX-SHIT) which comes from the P.I.E. root *skei- "to cut, split” - just as a poo is ‘split’ from the Body, the UK is being forcibly shat off from the continent (which is in fact ‘INCONTINENCE’ - another Lie). (Hope this doesn’t get me Banned from faecbook (faecesbook)). PROTO INDO EUROPEAN also means a ‘TORPEDOO IN OUR NAPE’ (neck).
PHIL OLOGIST MUST PAY FOR HIS LIES!

LEARN LATIN AND SAVE BRITAIN
